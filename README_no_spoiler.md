# RazorHack CTF 2024 - JS Gauntlet 2
#### by Alex Prosser

> We have received a message from a hacker group called *R3n3gad3s* that has seemed to taken over our communications systems. These systems allow us to not only communicate with our different power stations around the nations, but also our messages and calls as well! It seems like they are about to put it up for ransom, but we will not allow that! However, we seem to have little experience in the offensive side of this type of stuff... can you help us?
~ IT Team

The flags will take the structure of `flag{FLAG_HERE_XXXXX}`.

## Challenges

### 1. A Secret Code

> Well, it seems like that they expected us... They have locked our main dashboard out with a code of some sorts! How will we get around this? It has to airtight security, right?
~ Sven from IT

### 2. How Did You Get In Here?

> Ok, now that we can actually see what is happening, I've just realized that a lot of our system is modularized, and they isolated it all. We just need to recover it all, starting with our account system. Find a way to get access to our admin accounts, and we can definitely get somewhere...

### 3. Irresistible Force

> Ok, this seems like a crazy joke, but for us to get to our next system, we need to... play Pong. However, it seems like no one on the team can actually beat the bot they've programmed in. This feels embarassing to ask, but see what you can do.

### 4. Teleportation

> Who would have that they would have attached a VPN to all of our services, so now we can't access the warning services without being in the right location. While it would be cool to travel for a "vacation", I think we are going to do this on the cheap. Now the obvious question is what location, but a better question is why ask us?

### 5. We Are Doing This Again? 

> I can't help feel a sense of deja vu, but maybe because I went through a lot of corn mazes as a kid. Anyways, this seems to be the megamaze of my childhood dreams because it's 3D! I couldn't get through much, so I'll let you figure it out yourself...
~ Sven from IT

### 6. Best In Class

> We have recovered a good amount of services of our stuff, and that is good and all... But I see this as an opportunity to progress further. We have an internal system that checks how many IT tickets that we have completed within the last month. Now, I am no slacker, but my number are lower than they should. In fact, I need just one more tickets to reach the quota for the role of "Good IT Boy" for the month. However, our manager is the only one who can modify when a ticket is done as to prevent misuse. Can you, you know, up that number somehow?
~ Stanley from IT

### 7. We're Definitely Doing This Again...

> Okay, now this is starting to get annoying. I have actually seen this puzzle before, but they seem to have made it 100x harder by adding a 5 minute timer! This is impossible, so I am going to call it quits... 
~ John from IT

### 8. We Will Never Surrender!

> Ok, we got most of stuff back, but if we can get the master key, we can get access to the terminal and finally secure our systems. The problem is the only copy of the master key is on the server that the attackers have access to. After all this, it seems that they have locked it down and we cannot access any file. Please, this is the last thing I ask of you...
