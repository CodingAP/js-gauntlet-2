        const originalText = `Team, I hope this message finds you securely. You’ve been briefed on the situation, but I want to make it clear how delicate this operation is. We are dealing with a potential insider threat at our nuclear facility, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. If this individual is able to compromise any of our core systems—especially the reactor and cooling stations—the results could be catastrophic, not just for us, but for everyone in the surrounding area. Your objective is simple: find the intruder, confirm their methods, and neutralize the threat before any real damage is done. The trick is to do it without alerting them—or anyone else in the facility. You’ll be working under the guise of routine system audits and updates, but your real task is much more critical. You’ll be granted high-level access under the radar, which should allow you to monitor the plant’s network traffic and internal communications. We've already identified some data that should help you get started in your investigation. You’ll need to confirm if we’re dealing with a skilled saboteur or just someone testing boundaries. Do not communicate with anyone outside this team unless absolutely necessary, and if you need to reach me, use the secure channel we discussed in the briefing. We need this done quickly, quietly, and thoroughly. Time is not on our side. Report any findings directly to me. We can’t afford even the smallest mistake here. Good luck, and stay invisible.
